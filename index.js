// Set Some global variables


// Generate a random number between 1 and 100


// Game logic

    //increment the counter on each guess


    // update the guess counter


    //Clear guess input


    //get the current guess number


    //check the guess number against the random number
   
        //guess is more than secret number


        //guess is less than secert number
